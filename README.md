# Cub3d
ðŸŽ®ðŸ”« Simple 3D scene with graphical ray tracing algorithms

### 1) "make"
### 2) run with argument in "maps" folder

This is a group project that we did together with team mate from school21.

Use of C, use of basic algorithms, information research etc.
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable me to improve my skills in these areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.

I used the miniLibX. Either the version that is available on the operating system, or from its sources.
